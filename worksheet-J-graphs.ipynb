    "When talking about graphs there are the following terms you will need to be familiar with:\n",
    "* *Vertex* --> This is an individual point on a graph. In previous worksheets relating to linked lists and trees you will have heard these refered to as nodes.\n",
    "* *Edge* --> This a connection between two nodes. In linked lists and trees these edges were represented using references to other nodes (e.g., `next`, `left`, `right`). However, as we will see today, there are many other ways of representing edges.\n",
    "    * *Weight* --> Edges can have weight associated with them.  For example, if we are building a map of campus we could reprsent the distance between buildings through edge weight.\n",
    "    * *Direction* --> Graphs can have edges that only allow for traversal to another node in a single direction (directed) or in both directions (undirected).\n",

    "Adjacency lists are a bit more versitile than adjacency matrixcies for the following reasons:\n",

    "* For adjacency matricies we store information on every potential edge rather than just on those that exist which leads to a O(V^2) space complexity where V is the number of vertecies. With adjacency matricies we only need to store information on edges that exist in the graph so our space complexity is O(E) where E is the number of edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Check if the destination is already there.\n",
    "    * *Hint:* This will involve iterating over the list of edge, checking if any of the destinations are equal to the destination we want to add, and returning early if that is ever the case.\n",
    "3. If the destination is not already present create an instance of the edge class and add it to that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into trouble with step 2, you can move onto step three and then come back to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### -- Removing an Edge --\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing and edge is the most complex of the tasks you will be performing. It will involve the following steps:\n",
    "1. Get the list associated with the source vertex.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the list and find the index of the edge with the destination we are looking for in order to get it's index \n",
    "    * This can be done by making a function that finds and returns the index or setting a variable and breaking out of the for loop\n",
