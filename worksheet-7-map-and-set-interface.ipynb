    "List<String> lst = //...\n",

    "```java\n",
    "Map<K, V> map = //...\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `K` and `V` will be replaced by the data type you want the key and value to be respectively. For instance, if we want to create a map where they keys are string and the values are integers we would do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Map<String, Integer> newMap = //...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we can only have single values (e.g., string, integer) as the keys for dicionaries we can have any object we want ast the values. For instance, if we wanted to make a map where the keys are integers and the values are a list of string we could do the following:\n",
