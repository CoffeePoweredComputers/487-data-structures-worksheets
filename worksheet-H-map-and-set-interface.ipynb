    "You know that I am creating a list that is going to contain strings. This pattern holds for the map interface, however, no we have to concern ourselves with two values. The key and the value. This is still relatively straight foward as we can just use the following template:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Map<K, V> map = //...\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `K` and `V` will be replaced by the data type you want the key and value to be respectively. For instance, if we want to create a map where they keys are string and the values are integers we would do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Map<String, Integer> newMap = //...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we can only have single values (e.g., string, integer) as the keys for dicionaries we can have any object we want ast the values. For instance, if we wanted to make a map where the keys are integers and the values are a list of string we could do the following:\n",

We proceed through the collection of items, get the previous count, increment it by one, and update it. However, each time we encounter a new word we need to first add it to our map. This means we will use the `containsKey` method to check if the key exists in our map. If it does we can just get the previous value, increment it, and update the value for that key-value pair with the `put` method. However, if it doesnt we simply put the new key in the map with the value 1 since this is the first time we've seen it. \n",
