    "\n",
    "For classes:\n",
    "* `public`: The class can be accessed by any other class.\n",
    "* default: Only classes within the same project can access a class with default access level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this class either `public` or default will be acceptable since we are only building and using classes within the context of a single package. \n",
    "\n",
    "For attributes and methods:\n",
    "* `public`: The attribute and method is accessiable to any other class that instantiates, implements, or extends the class in which it resides.\n",
    "* `private`: The method of attribute is only accessible with the class.\n",
    "* `protected`: The methods or attributes are only accessiable within the same package or within a subclass.\n",
    "* default: The methods or attributes are only accessiable within the same package.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover packages and the notion of subclasses in more detail later so don't concern yourself with `protected` or default access. Additionally, it is most common to use `public` or `private` so outside of being aware of `protected` and default you will not need to use them in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is a special method that is called when a class is instantiated and defines how the class is to be setup. Java does provide a default instructor when one isn't defined. Constructors are typically used for initializing class attributes using values passed in via parameters. Classes can have multiple constructors which are distiguished using the [method overloading rules of Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods_overloading.asp). Below are some examples of constructors for a class containing information on coffee:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Coffee{\n",
    "    \n",
    "    private String brand;\n",

    "    Coffee(){\n",
    "        brand = null;\n",
    "        roastType = null;\n",
    "        amountInOz = null;\n",
    "        rating = null;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    //Sets all attributes\n",
    "    Coffee(String brand, String roastType, String amountInOz){\n",
    "        this.brand = brand;\n",
    "        this.roastType = roastType;\n",
    "        this.amountInOz = amountInOz;\n",

    "        this.roastType = roastType;\n",
    "        this.amountInOz = amountInOz;\n",
    "        this.rating = rating;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    //...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Getters and Setters\n",
    "\n",
    "In keeping with concept of [encapusulation](), we will need to define getters and setters for the attributes to define and control which attributes the user of the class has read and write access to, respectively. Getters and setters generally follow the form of having the first word be `get` or `set` followed by the name of the attribute it is intended to read from or write to. For instance, if we have an string attribute `name` we would define the getter to be `getName` and the setter to be `setName`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public String getName(){\n",
    "    return name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public void setName(String name){\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "As stated, this is to control access to private attributes so, if we wanted the user of the class to read the name but not change the name of an instance of a class we would provide a getter method but not a setter method. If the private attribute was only used in the class and is not intended to be used by the user in any way we would provide neither a setter or getter method for that attribute thus making it invisible to the user.

    "An interface is a special type of class in java which contains **only the prototypes of methods**. As such, it is defining the structure without providing implementation of that structure.

    "At this point you might be wondering \"why do we have these two different implementations of list???\". And the answer is there are some significant differences between the implementations of the two classes beyond the unique methods each provides. A few of the key differences are:\n",
    "1. An `ArrayList` dynamically grows by first checking if it has room for a new element and, if it doesnt, growing by a set amount. Thus, it only needs to allocate new memory when it has run out of room. A `LinkedList` adds each new element in a new \"chunk\" everytime a new element is added and therefore it must perform memory allocation every time  you wish to add data to it.\n",
    "2. Removing elements from an `ArrayList` is slower since the entire array must be adjusted if an element is moved in the middle. Since each element in a `LinkedList` is in it's own \"chunk\" removing an element doesn't effect any of the other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, `ArrayList` is generally better for storing and reading data and `LinkedList` is better for data you intend to manipulate a lot. Later on in the course we will have you implement your own linked list at which point you will gain a better understanding of how a LinkedList methods and how it differs from a dynamic array."
