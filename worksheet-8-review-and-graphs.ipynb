    "* **Directed**: This means that links between nodes only move in one direction. With linked list this is the `next` reference and with trees this are the `left` and `right` references. Once you have progressed `next`, `left`, or `right` the only way backwards is if a `parent` reference exists.\n",
    "* **Acyclic**: In an acyclic graph, one can never visit the same node twice betcause there are no cycles. The singly linked list and a tree without parent references both meet this definition. For example, if we visit the root node of a BST and then traverse downwards we will never visit the same no twice because no node lower in the tree references another node that is higher in the tree. A doubly linked list, however, wouldn't be acyclic as it is possible to go backwards and revisit a node.\n",
    "* **Graph**: A collection of nodes and edges. A node is just like the nodes you've previously seen in linked lists and trees. An edge is similar to the `next`, `left`, and `right` references you've seen. However, references are not the only way to construct edges. We will explore more versitile graph representations further in future lessons.\n",

    "The doubly linked list we impelmented at the beginning of the worksheet is a departure from the world of DAGs as, compared to it's singly linked cousin, you are able to traverse back and forth arbitrarily. This means that you can therefore revisit nodes that you might have visited before which makes them effectively undirected and certainly acyclic. However, our previous data structures are still limited in the following ways:\n",
